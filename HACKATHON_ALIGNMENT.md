# Hackathon Alignment Analysis
## NSBE InnoTech AI Impact-A-Thon 2025

### Hackathon Theme
**"Reimagining Housing Equity Through Smart Communities"**
- Focus: Addressing racial disparities in homeownership
- Problem: 70% White homeownership vs <45% Black homeownership
- Goal: Use AI to bridge the housing equity gap

### Current Project Status

#### ✅ **STRONG ALIGNMENTS:**

#### ⚠️ **AREAS NEEDING ADJUSTMENT:**

1. **Primary Focus Mismatch**

   - **Action**: Reframe to emphasize homeownership as the primary goal

2. **Problem Statement**

   - **Needed**: Explicitly address the racial homeownership gap
   - **Action**: Update hero section and messaging

     - Mortgage Types & Options
     - Housing Policy Analysis
     - Appraisal & Equity Building
   - **Action**: Add/prioritize housing courses

4. **Chatbot Focus**

   - **Needed**: Emphasize homeownership readiness topics:
     - Credit building for mortgages
     - Down payment assistance programs
     - First-time buyer programs
     - Housing policy questions
   - **Action**: Enhance chatbot system prompt and responses

5. **Missing Hackathon Focus Areas**
   - **Focus Area #1**: AI for Fair Housing Policy Analysis (needs more emphasis)
   - **Focus Area #2**: Predictive Mapping (not currently addressed)
   - **Focus Area #3**: Smart Infrastructure (not addressed)
   - **Focus Area #4**: Homeownership Readiness ✅ (partially covered)
